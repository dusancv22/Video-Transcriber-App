## Architecture

### System Architecture
The application follows a modular, layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

**Presentation Layer (UI):**
- PyQt6-based main window with modern styling
- Real-time progress widgets and status reporting
- Queue management interface with visual file status
- Worker thread integration for non-blocking operations

**Business Logic Layer:**
- TranscriptionPipeline: Orchestrates the complete processing workflow
- QueueManager: Thread-safe queue operations and status tracking
- WhisperManager: AI model management and transcription coordination
- TextProcessor: Post-processing and formatting operations

**Data Processing Layer:**
- AudioConverter: Video-to-audio conversion and file management
- File handlers: Input validation and format verification
- Progress tracking: Real-time status updates and time estimation

**Infrastructure Layer:**
- Logging system with configurable levels
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Temporary file management and cleanup
- Threading and synchronization primitives

### Database Schema
**File-based system** - No traditional database. State managed through:
- Queue data structures (in-memory)
- File system for input/output management
- Temporary audio files in structured directories
- Configuration stored in object properties

### Processing Pipeline
1. **File Input & Validation:** User selects files/directories → File format validation → Queue population
2. **Audio Conversion:** Video loading → Audio extraction → File size checking → Splitting if needed (>25MB)
3. **AI Transcription:** Whisper model loading → Segment processing → Text generation → Language detection
4. **Post-Processing:** Text chunking → Formatting enhancement → Sentence structure correction
5. **Output Generation:** File writing → Cleanup → Status reporting

### State Management
- **Queue State:** Thread-safe QueueManager with atomic operations
- **Progress State:** Real-time updates via PyQt signals and slots
- **UI State:** Reactive interface updates based on processing status
- **File State:** Temporary file tracking with automatic cleanup

## Authentication System
**Not applicable** - Desktop application with local file access only. No user authentication or network services required.

## UI/UX Patterns

### Visual Design Principles
- **Modern Flat Design:** Clean buttons with hover effects and professional color scheme
- **Status-Driven UI:** Visual indicators for queue item states (⏳ queued, 🔄 processing, ✓ completed, ❌ failed)
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Hide advanced options until needed (progress section appears during processing)
- **Responsive Feedback:** Immediate visual feedback for all user actions

### Interaction Patterns
- **Drag & Drop Support:** Primary file input method for intuitive operation
- **Batch Operations:** Support for directory selection with recursive file discovery
- **Pause/Resume Control:** User control over long-running operations
- **Real-time Updates:** Live progress bars and time estimates
- **Error Recovery:** Clear error messages with actionable guidance

### Color Coding System
- **Blue (#2563eb):** Primary actions (Add Files, Add Directory)
- **Gray (#4b5563):** Secondary actions (Output Directory)
- **Red (#dc2626):** Destructive actions (Clear Queue)
- **Green (#16a34a):** Success states and primary processing action
- **Yellow (#eab308):** Warning states and pause functionality
