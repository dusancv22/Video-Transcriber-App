## ???? Installation

### Option 1: Download Pre-built Executable (Windows)

1. Download the latest `VideoTranscriber.exe` from the [Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/video-transcriber/releases) page
2. Download Whisper model files (see [Model Setup](#model-setup) below)
3. Run `VideoTranscriber.exe`

### Option 2: Run from Source

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or higher
- NVIDIA GPU (optional, for faster processing)
- CUDA 11.8 or 12.1 (if using GPU)

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/video-transcriber.git
cd video-transcriber
```

#### Step 2: Create Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### Step 3: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Step 4: Install PyTorch with CUDA (for GPU support)
```bash
# For CUDA 11.8
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

# For CUDA 12.1
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

# For CPU only
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

#### Step 5: Run the Application
```bash
python run.py
```

## ???? Model Setup

### Understanding Whisper Models

The app uses OpenAI's Whisper models for transcription. Each model size offers different trade-offs:

| Model | Parameters | Speed | Quality | Download Size |
|-------|------------|-------|---------|---------------|
| tiny  | 39M | Very Fast | Basic | ~39 MB |
| base  | 74M | Fast | Good | ~74 MB |
| small | 244M | Moderate | Better | ~244 MB |
| medium | 769M | Slow | Very Good | ~769 MB |
| large | 1550M | Very Slow | Best | ~1.5 GB |

### Automatic Model Download

On first use, the app will automatically download the selected model from OpenAI (requires internet connection).

### Manual Model Setup (Recommended for Offline Use)

1. **Download Model Files**
   - Download `.pt` files from [OpenAI Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper/releases)
   - Or from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/openai)

2. **Place Models in a Folder**
   ```
   C:\WhisperModels\
   ????????? tiny.pt
   ????????? base.pt
   ????????? small.pt
   ????????? medium.pt
   ????????? large-v3.pt
   ```

3. **Load in Application**
   - Click "Load Model Folder" button
   - Navigate to your models folder
   - Select the folder containing `.pt` files
   - The app will remember this location

## ???? Usage Guide

### Basic Workflow

1. **Start the Application**
   - Run `VideoTranscriber.exe` or `python run.py`

2. **Configure Settings**
   - Select output directory for transcripts
   - Choose Whisper model size (larger = better quality, slower)
   - (Optional) Load custom model folder

3. **Add Videos**
   - Click "Add Files" to select videos
   - Or "Add Directory" to process entire folders
   - Or drag and drop files directly

4. **Process Videos**
   - Click "Start Processing"
   - Monitor progress in real-time
   - Pause/resume as needed

5. **Get Results**
   - Transcripts saved as `.txt` files
   - Same filename as video with `.txt` extension
   - Located in your selected output directory

### Advanced Features

#### GPU Acceleration
The app automatically detects and uses NVIDIA GPUs. Check status in console output:
- `Model loaded successfully on cuda` = GPU active ???
- `Model loaded successfully on cpu` = CPU only ??????

#### Batch Processing Tips
- Queue processes videos in order (FIFO)
- Each video's transcript is saved immediately upon completion
- Failed videos don't stop the queue
- Time estimates improve as more videos are processed

#### Text Processing Options
The app automatically:
- Removes filler words while preserving meaning
- Adds proper punctuation and capitalization
- Creates readable paragraphs
- Fixes common transcription errors

## ???? Building from Source

### Creating Executable

1. **Install PyInstaller**
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. **Run Build Script**
   ```bash
   # Windows
   build_exe.bat
   
   # Or manually
   pyinstaller VideoTranscriber.spec --clean
   ```

3. **Find Executable**
   - Located in `dist/VideoTranscriber.exe`
   - Single file, ready for distribution

### Customizing Build
Edit `VideoTranscriber.spec` to:
- Add custom icon
- Include additional files
- Modify build options

## ???? Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No model found" error**
- Ensure `.pt` files are in the selected folder
- File names should contain model size (e.g., `large.pt`, `large-v3.pt`)

**Slow processing on CPU**
- Install CUDA-enabled PyTorch (see installation)
- Use smaller model (base or small)
- Check GPU is detected in console output

**"CUDA out of memory" error**
- Use smaller model
- Close other GPU applications
- Process shorter videos

**Transcription has repeated text**
- App includes automatic repetition removal
- Update to latest version
- Report persistent issues

### Performance Tips

1. **For Speed**: Use GPU + smaller models (base/small)
2. **For Quality**: Use large model with GPU
3. **For Long Videos**: Videos auto-split into segments
4. **For Batch Processing**: Queue overnight with large model
