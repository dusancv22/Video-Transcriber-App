## Current Development Status

The transcription repetition bug has been successfully resolved with a comprehensive three-layer solution. The bug fix is complete and ready for deployment. The focus now shifts to final validation and preparation for production release.

## Active Tasks

### Final Validation & Deployment

#### User Acceptance Testing - HIGH PRIORITY
- [ ] **User acceptance testing**
  - Validate fix resolves original user complaint with real problematic file
  - Test with diverse real-world audio content types
  - Verify transcription quality maintains accuracy in production
  - Confirm user experience improvements

#### Edge Case Testing - MEDIUM PRIORITY  
- [~] **Manual testing checklist**
  - ‚úÖ Solution tested with synthetic problematic scenarios
  - ‚úÖ Tested with various file types and processing methods
  - ‚úÖ Tested with different audio qualities and characteristics
  - üîÑ Need to test edge cases (very short/long files, multiple speakers)

#### Deployment Preparation - HIGH PRIORITY
- [ ] **Prepare deployment**
  - Code review and approval process needed
  - Version control and branching strategy (ready for commit)
  - Deployment testing in staging environment
  - Release notes preparation for bug fix

### Repository Cleanup - IMMEDIATE
- [ ] **Clean up temporary files**
  - Remove debug_repetition.py from root directory
  - Remove test_formatting_fix.py from root directory
  - Clean up any additional temporary/debug files
  - Ensure repository is ready for commit

### Technical Debt - LOW PRIORITY
- [ ] **Code optimization opportunities**
  - Review performance bottlenecks in TextCombiner
  - Optimize memory usage in large file processing
  - Consider caching strategies for repeated operations
  - Clean up any remaining TODO comments

### Documentation - LOW PRIORITY
- [ ] **User-facing documentation updates**
  - Update user guide with improved transcription quality information
  - Add troubleshooting section for transcription issues
  - Document best practices for video file preparation
